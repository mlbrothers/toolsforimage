        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">TIFF and JPEG</span> are two of the most widely used image formats, but they serve
            different
            purposes. TIFF is known for retaining high-quality details, making it a preferred format for
            professional photographers and designers. On the other hand, JPEG is a compressed format
            that is more suitable for web use, sharing, and saving storage space. If you find yourself
            needing to <a href="/convert/tiff-to-jpeg" class="bold-text">convert TIFF to JPEG</a>, this guide will walk
            you through the process.

            Before diving into
            <a href="/convert/tiff-to-jpeg" class="bold-text">how to convert TIFF to JPEG</a>, it’s essential to
            understand why you might
            need to convert between the two formats. <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span> files are often large due to
            their lossless
            compression, meaning no quality is lost in the image. JPEG files, however, are compressed,
            allowing for faster loading times and smaller file sizes. This makes JPEG more convenient for
            online use, while <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span> is often used for printing or archiving images in
            their highest quality.

            format to a lossy one. The compression in JPEG images means that some details in the image
            might be lost, but for everyday use, this loss is minimal and usually unnoticeable. A high-quality

            process.
