    <h1>JPEG to JPG Conversion Guide</h1>
    <p><em>Published on: October 15, 2024</em></p>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><span class="bold-text">JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</span> and <span class="bold-text">JPG</span>
            are both image file formats commonly used
            for storing digital photos. The primary difference between <span class="bold-text">JPEG</span> and <span
                class="bold-text">JPG</span> is the number of
            characters in the file extension: <span class="bold-text">JPEG</span> has four characters, while <span
                class="bold-text">JPG</span> has three. This difference
            originated from early Windows systems, which required three-letter extensions, hence JPG was
            used. Functionally, they are identical, both using lossy compression to reduce file size while
            maintaining image quality. Whether it's <span class="bold-text">JPEG</span> or <span
                class="bold-text">JPG</span>, the formats are interchangeable, and
            most devices and software recognize and support both without issues.</p>
