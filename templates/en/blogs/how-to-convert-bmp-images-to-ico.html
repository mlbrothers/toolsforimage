        <p>
            The BMP file format, short for Bitmap, is a raster image format widely used for storing high-quality images without compression. BMP files preserve image details and are compatible with almost all graphic software. These files are ideal for creating base designs for icons due to their lossless quality.

The ICO format allows users to save multiple resolutions of the same icon in one file, making it scalable for different display sizes.
