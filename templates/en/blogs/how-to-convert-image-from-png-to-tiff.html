        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</span> is a widely used image format known for its
            lossless
            compression. This means that when an image is saved as a PNG, it retains its quality without
            sacrificing file size significantly. This format is ideal for images with transparent backgrounds,
            graphics, and illustrations. On the other hand, <span class="bold-text">TIFF (Tagged Image File
                Format)</span> is a format
            known for handling very high-quality images. It's often used by professionals in fields such as
            graphic design, photography, and publishing due to its ability to store large amounts of detailed
            image data. The <span class="bold-text">TIFF meaning and use case</span> revolve around scenarios where
            maintaining
            high fidelity is necessary, particularly for images that undergo frequent editing or need to be
            printed in high resolution.
