    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to image formats, <span class="bold-text">BMP and PNG</span> are two commonly used file types,
            each
            serving a specific purpose. <span class="bold-text">BMP, or Bitmap</span>, is an uncompressed image file
            format that retains
            high-quality images but comes at the cost of large file sizes. To understand BMP meaning, it's
            essential to know that <span class="bold-text">BMP</span> stores data pixel by pixel, which can result in
            more detailed images
            but takes up significant storage space.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, <span class="bold-text">PNG, short for Portable Network Graphics</span>, is a format
            designed for efficient
            image compression without losing quality. To grasp the PNG meaning, you need to know that
            PNG uses lossless compression, making it ideal for web use, especially when you need to
            preserve transparency and image quality in a more compact file size compared to BMP.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are times when you may need to convert between these two formats, particularly from
            <span class="bold-text">BMP to PNG</span>. You might want to do this to reduce file size without sacrificing
            much quality.
