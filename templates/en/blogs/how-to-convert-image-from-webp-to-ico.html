            WebP supports both lossless and lossy compression, which makes it ideal for web use, as it
            reduces file sizes significantly without compromising on visual fidelity. Lossless WebP can
            compress images by around 26% more than PNG, and lossy WebP is about 25-34% smaller
            than JPEG. WebP supports transparency (alpha channel) and animation, adding to its flexibility
            for different use cases like web graphics and multimedia.
