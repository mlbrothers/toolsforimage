        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">WebP</span> is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior
            compression for
            images on the web, making them smaller without compromising quality. <span class="bold-text">\What exactly
                is the
                WebP meaning?WebP stands for Web Picture format</span>, designed to reduce the size of images
            without affecting their resolution or overall quality, making it ideal for web use. On the other
            hand, <span class="bold-text">BMP, which stands for Bitmap</span>, is a standard image format that has been
            around for
            years. BMP meaning refers to a bitmap image file, which is an uncompressed, high-quality
            format that results in much larger file sizes compared to WebP. BMP is primarily used in
            Windows environments for high-quality image storage.
