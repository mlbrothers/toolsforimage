    <h1>Rotate Images</h1>
    <p><em>Published on: October 22, 2024</em></p>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> <span class="bold-text">Image rotation</span> is the process of turning an image around a specific point,
            usually its
            center. This manipulation changes the orientation of the image without altering its content.
            <span class="bold-text">Rotating images</span> can be done in various degrees, such as 90, 180, or 270
            degrees,
            depending on the desired outcome. This technique is essential in photography, graphic
            design, and social media, where the right orientation can enhance the visual appeal and
            message of an image.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rotating an image is crucial for several reasons. First, it allows you to correct the
            orientation of photos taken at awkward angles, ensuring that your images appear
            professional. Second, it can help in creating more dynamic compositions, making your
            visuals more engaging. Additionally,
            rotating images can aid in highlighting specific
            elements or improving the overall aesthetic of a design. Whether for personal use or
            professional projects,
            <span class="bold-text">rotating images</span> can significantly impact how they are perceived.
