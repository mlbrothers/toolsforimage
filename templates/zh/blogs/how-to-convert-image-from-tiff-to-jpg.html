    <h1>TIFF to JPG Conversion Guide</h1>
    <p><em>Published on: October 20, 2024</em></p>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span>, which stands for <span class="bold-text">Tagged Image File
                Format</span>, is a high-quality image format used by
            photographers and graphic designers. The meaning and use case of <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span>
            typically relate to
            preserving image data without losing quality. This makes it ideal for print media, professional
            photography, and when you need large, uncompressed files for high-quality outputs. On the
            other hand, <span class="bold-text">JPG, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</span>, is one of the
            most common
            image formats. The meaning of JPG revolve around file compression. <span class="bold-text">JPG</span> images
            are smaller
            in size because they are compressed, making them perfect for websites, social media, and any
            situation where file size matters more than retaining every detail of the image.
        </p>

            when working with different devices or platforms. For example, you may need to
            <a href="/convert/tiff-to-jpg" class="bold-text">convert TIFF to JPG</a> for web use because <span
                class="bold-text">JPG</span> images load faster due to their smaller size. You can
