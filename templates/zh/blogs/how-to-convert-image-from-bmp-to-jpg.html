    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> <span class="bold-text">BMP (Bitmap)</span> is an uncompressed image format that stores high-quality images
            with precise
            detail, making it ideal for detailed graphics but resulting in large file sizes. <span class="bold-text">JPG
                (Joint
                Photographic Group)</span> is a compressed format that reduces file size by discarding some image
            data, making it more suitable for web use, sharing, and storage. The main difference between
            <span class="bold-text">BMP</span> and <span class="bold-text">JPG</span> is compression: <span
                class="bold-text">BMP</span> retains all image data, while <span class="bold-text">JPG</span> uses lossy
            compression
            to create smaller files. This makes BMP better for high-detail images and JPG more practical for
            everyday use due to its reduced size.
        </p>

        <p>When dealing with image formats, two common types are <span class="bold-text">BMP</span> and <span
                class="bold-text">JPEG</span>. <span class="bold-text">BMP</span> is a large,
            uncompressed format often used for high-quality images. On the other hand, <span
                class="bold-text">JPEG</span> offers
            compressed files, making them smaller in size while maintaining decent quality. This makes
            converting <a href="/convert/bmp-to-jpg" class="bold-text">BMP to JPG</a> a popular choice for people who
            need to save space without
            compromising too much on image clarity. In this post, we will guide you through the process of
