    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to working with digital images, understanding different <span class="bold-text">file
                formats</span> is crucial,
            especially when handling formats like <span class="bold-text">BMP and TIFF</span>. <span
                class="bold-text">BMP, short for Bitmap</span>, is a widely used
            format for storing digital images, particularly on Windows systems. <span class="bold-text">BMP</span>
            meaning is simple—an
            uncompressed, large file format that retains high-quality images but can take up significant
            space. On the other hand, <span class="bold-text">TIFF, or Tagged Image File Format</span>, is known for its
            flexibility in
            handling large images and is often used in professional environments, such as in graphic
            design and photography. <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span> meaning revolves around a format that supports
            multiple layers,
            making it ideal for high-quality editing and printing tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're looking to switch between these formats, <span class="bold-text">converting BMP to TIFF</span> may
            be a necessary
            task. This is where

        <h2>How to Convert image from bitmap/BMP to TIFF</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="step">Step 1: Select a bmp format image to convert it into tiff
                format</div>
            <div class="arrow">↓</div>
            <div class="step">Step 2: Hit the "Upload BMP image" button and select image
                from computer, you can see the preview of image</div>
            <div class="arrow">↓</div>

                image to tiff format and download it automatically</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The use case of <span class="bold-text">BMP files</span> often revolves around simple tasks where image quality is more
            important than file size, such as storing raw images from a scanner. On the other hand, the use
            case of <span class="bold-text">TIFF</span> files is more advanced. TIFF is often used when working with detailed, high
            resolution images that need to be edited multiple times, such as in professional photography,
            graphic design, or medical imaging.
